There are a lot of issue tracking systems in the industry.

For famous ones, Atlassian's JIRA. Increasingly, many open-source projects use GitHub's Issues sytem to track bugs and enhancement requests.

Customer Support desks in various companies might use their own or 3rd party tracking systems to record details about issues. 

The idea here is that, as the company grows and the frequency of issues increase, you might need to choose the tracking system carefully.

For example, JIRA is probably too slow when there are 10 issues to track every day by a single person.

In that case, you might use it as a backend where you provide a short-cut quick method to enter issues.

You might mix different systems when you separate:
* daily issues (resolved in 1 ~ 2 days)
* enhancement requests (takes days ~ weeks)
* fixes (takes days ~ a week)
