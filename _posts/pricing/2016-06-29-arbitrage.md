Pricing Software in Financial Arbitrage Context - Intro
Let's start a discussion on pricing software under a Financial arbitrage context. Pricing a contract under the arbitrage context is a fundamental technique in Finance, so we are introducing the same technique in software pricing.

Financial Arbitrage, when the same product is in different prices
What is arbitrage in finance? It is a trading method, to make a profit from the difference in prices, on the same product. The following video by Khan Academy gives good basics of arbitrage.


Usually it is very rare that there is a pure arbitrage opportunity. (i.e.) same exact products are traded in two different prices. Most of the time, there is no such case, or there is too little price difference so that your arbitrage profit would be diminished by tax and trading cost.

If you have an arbitrage opportunity on a certain product, as in the video, the price difference will converge to a point where there is no more arbitrage ooportunity. In other words, you can say:

if you see an arbitrage opportunity, the product is wrongly priced
the correct price of the product is so that there is no arbitrage opportunity
For software, you cannot easily sell or buy it
To expand the same arbitrage-based pricing discussion to software, there is actually a big problem - you cannot easily sell or buy software. As in a previous article, "Pricing and Accounting Software - Asset", you can buy software easily, only when the software is packaged.

For example, when an external investor comes in, and he is interested in your precious e-Commerse software, "e-Sale". Does he just buy the software only? No he doesn't. Just buying software doesn't do anything - the investor actually wants to acquire the entire e-Commerce business, including people supporting the software and the business.

You know that is what happens in actual tech businesses. It's M&A where known cases are like:

Google bought youtube
Microsoft bought Dropbox
...etc,
They just didn't buy software only, but they bought the entire businesses and the people, to keep running the same service after the mergers.
So unlike financial markets, even if a software product is wrongly priced, it is not easy to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity. This results in a prevalent situation in the software industry, so that most software product is wrongly priced, since arbitrage dynamics to correct prices does not work.

Pricing Software, by assuming it as a complex Financial Derivative contract

As discussed, we cannot just buy or sell software easily. Thus, you don't know the exact price of software.

So, pricing software is just an exercise bound to failure? Not actually, to price software, you can assume it as a complex derivative contract, and de-compose it into cash flows it consists of.

Incoming cash flows = Revenue
Outgoing cash flows = Cost
Put simply,

Software Value = Revenue - Cost = Net cash flow

However, it is much more difficult than it might look like - the reasons why I said it is a "complex" derivative are because:

Revenues are unknown in advance,
Maintenance cost is also unknown in advance
Also, even if revenues and maintenance cost are "known" when they became past-dated, it is hard to tell what percentage of them is from software's contribution. You can see the below articles about more discussion.
Pricing and Accounting Software - Income
Pricing and Accounting Software - Expenses
In future articles, we model software as a complex derivative contract with unknown cash flows, and we will see how that enables the arbitrage argument to give a price of software.



Market Efficiency and Arbitrage
Other than buying and selling software, another form of economic activity on software is retirement and replacement.

Arbitrage is possible when there is Inefficiency in the market

Arbitrage is possible when someone is doing either:

Buy (Paying) too high -> paying too much cost in your software
Selling too low -> package price too low
In the software industry, what you pay is buying a software product, investing in a long-term project, or spending maintenance or license (subscription) fee.

What is market Efficiency? Definition in Economics
So what does efficiency/inefficiency mean? As described by Investopedia, the following is the definition of "Market Efficiency" in Economics.

Strong efficiency
This is the strongest version, which states that all information in a market, whether public or private, is accounted for in a stock price. Not even insider information could give an investor an advantage.
Semi-strong efficiency
This form of EMH (Efficient Market Hypothesis) implies that all public information is calculated into a stock's current share price. Neither fundamental nor technical analysis can be used to achieve superior gains.
Weak efficiency
This type of EMH (Efficient Market Hypothesis) claims that all past prices of a stock are reflected in today's stock price. Therefore, technical analysis cannot be used to predict and beat a market.
In other words, being efficient is making a price decision using all available information. On the other hand, inefficiency means making a price decision without using all available information, or making an irrational price decision based on all available information.

Arbitrage in software is in an imperfect form, because Re-Sell is impossible
So, is arbitrage really possible in software? This is bit tricky, since Re-Sell in software is impossible. In Financial markets, arbitrage includes both buying and selling transactions. Thus in the software industry, pure form of arbitrage is generally not possible.

In software, as discussed in Software Replacement as Risk Arbitrage, you can get rid of old software product or system, and switch to a new one, if you are almost sure there is cost-saving effect.

However, "almost sure" doesn't mean 100% sure, so this is a form of risk arbitrage, where uncertainty still remains.
