Pricing and Accounting Software - Asset
In this article we explore possibilities of accounting software as asset. In previous articles, we have investigated ideas of representing software in terms of accounting, although they are not strict argument in accounting theories

Accounting package software is easy as you know the price
When you purchased a packaged software product, it is easy to tell the asset value of the software. That is just the purchase price (and if necessary, you apply "depreciation" accounting).


Accounting internally developed software ... how to price it?
On the other hand, it becomes difficult when you try to evaluate the software you developed internally in your company.

One possible approach is to calculate "Discounted Cash Flow" which is generated from your software. In this case, the cashflow is the revenue generated from the software.


However, that is not almost always impossible. As we saw in the previous article, it is not your software which generates the revenue, but your entire business generates the cashflow.


Internally developed software is priced to zero !? As no one buys your software
For almost all companies, no one else will buy your software. If anyone does, he/she buys your entire company or your entire business, rather than just software. That is different from other non-physical assets, like intellectual properties. If you have copyright of famous musician's songs, some investors might want to buy them. However, if you developed software for your own company, no matter how good it is, no one would buy it. So, no one buys your software ... then its price must be zero?
