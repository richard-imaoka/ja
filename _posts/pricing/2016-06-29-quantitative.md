Software Engineering, complemented by Financial Engineering for quantitative analysis, business decisions
Programmers are passionate about better software, and better methodologies. We have seen tremendous growth in software technologies and methodologies, but yet business decisions on software projects haven't been improved over the last 20 to 30 years.

Software Engineering has been successful in creating great software products
Like you can see many people signed up for "Software Craftsmanship Manifesto", programmers are self-driven, serious people, willing to make the world better with technologies. Thus there has always been tremendous innovations in the software industry.

For example, I am always impressed by the fast paced development of web front-end frameworks and libraries, which people usually say "trends change every half a year". Web front-end programmers are doing pretty good job trying to resolve problems which many other people face, in this rapid moving environment.


Not only about software itself, also there has been a lot of effort in software development processes. Best practices are shared and publicized, and modern development environment has automated test with good coverage, strict but active code review process, issues and enhancement requests are tracked in one place, building process is becoming more and more automated.


Most software projects still fail today
OK, so now programmers know how to create great software, is it getting easier to make software projects successful?

The answer is sadly no. Still, most of software projects fail, or at their best, deliver software with poor quality. You can see the references about failed projects.

Software Engineering has been "Craftsmaship" rather than Science
Did those projects fail because the programmers and project managers were not skilled enough? That is true to some extent.

However, this Craftsmanship mind, focusing on right use of technologies and methodologies lacks a significantly important point. There is harsh truth:

Projects still fail, no matter how skilled programmer you are.
Do you think top level programmers, with excellent project managers, will make every project successful? Certain percentage of projects will fail even though you hire the best people. Creating and maintaining Software is now truly a business, and there is no single business you know it will succeed, no matter how skilled people you have. And what's more, in real world, that is just impossible to hire the best people. Every company lacks well skilled developers, well skilled project managers, but they still need to do their business.

Software Craftsmanship - building up on Software Engineering skills is very important, but it is only one side of the story. You also need to learn about how to make sound business judgement, as you cannot always expect top level programmers to work for your company.

Financial Engineering for quantitative analysis, and sound business judgement under uncertainty
There are important questions like below, traditional Software Engineering didn't answer:

Does this new technology saves us money, or actually we lose money?
How likely does my project get extended?
Two good technologies - which fits us better?
Replacing a legacy system, or invest in something else?
Total cost of software project ... including maintenance cost
These questions could be answered if you have adequate expertise on subject technologies and methodologies. If you are a Object Oriented Programming expert, you know what benefits it brings to your company. However, at the same time, are you also a Functional Programming expert? What if project managers think Functional styles would bring certain benefit but they are not sure if they are willing to invest in it? You need to answer to such questions in real world, without having time to learn about everything.

Financial Engineering frameworks are exactly built to meet such a situation - you don't know what happens in the future, but you still make investment decisions. Financial Engineering enhances Software Engineering especially in the following aspects:

Quantitative analysis of software development cost and maintenance cost
Probabilistic frameworks to make business decisions, under uncertainty
I am excited to introduce methodologies, and more excited to hear about suggestions and critiques from others, to build this framework better and more robust!
