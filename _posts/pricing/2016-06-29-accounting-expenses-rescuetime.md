Pricing and Accounting Software - Expenses, Time-Tracking with RescueTime
In the previous article, we demonstrated that if we know the time usage of each person, we can calculate the maintenance cost of software. Let's explore a method to track time usage here.

RescueTime tracks your time usage by application, and web site
RescueTime is a cloud-based application, which tracks your time usage. From its website, it works as follows:

Runs securely in the background on your computer and mobile devices.
Tracks time spent on applications and websites, giving you an accurate picture of your day.
Gives you detailed reports and data based on your activity.
So, the detailed report looks like this.

To track the time usage, RescueTime desktop process automatically starts when you start your PC. Then, when you move "focus" to (mouse click on) any application, then it tracks the time spent on the application, until you move focus to another application.


For web browsers, RescueTime can give more detailed tracking, by each web page.

The collected time usage data is sent to RescueTime's cloud, and aggregated to show the report like shown at the top of this article.
RescueTime is very useful, but analysis from different aspects needed
RescueTime, as it is not intended for software maintenance cost calculation (so it's not a complaint for RescueTime at all), there are challenges.

For example, if you use Text Editor to write code for your application, maybe "e-Sales", the time is recorded for Text Editor. However, in such a case, you actually want the time recorded for e-Sales, not Text Editor. (i.e.) RescueTime keeps track of applications you use, but you want to keep track of applications you support.

To more accurately calculate your software's maintenance cost, you would also other differnet kinds of software metrics and develop your own cost calculation models based on various metrics. We'll explore the possibilities of leveraging such metrics in later blog posts.
