Pricing and Accounting Software - Expenses, Time-Tracking for Maintenance Cost Calculation
In the previous article, we demonstrated that if we know the time usage of each person, we can calculate the maintenance cost of software. Let's explore a method to track time usage here.

Expenses is mainly maintenance cost of your software
As previously discussed in earlier posts, I split software into the four components as below. In this article, I'll explain the bottom left component in the below picture, how to calculate the expenses of your software.


Example: Single-Application E-commerce company
In the real world, calculating software maintenance cost is pretty complicated. A lot of people with different roles might use the same software, including developers, DevOps people, designers, etc. Also there could be hardware and electricity costs associated the software.

To avoid complexity, I use a very simple setup here to illustrate how it works.


Let's assume there is an E-commerce company whose business is solely run on their single web software application, "e-Sales". And then let's also assume there are 3 developers supporting the e-Sales software. They maintain and enhance the e-Sales.
If we could somehow measure the percentage of their time usage, and time usage by each developer can be like this. For the rest of the time other than e-Sales support, they might be e-maling, attending meetings, etc.


What's the salary of each developer monthly? that could be like below, then the monthly maintenance cost of the e-sales software is:


$3,800 x 30% + $3,500 x 50% + $4,000 x 45% 
= $4,690 / Month

Good, with this simple formula, and (a lof of) assumptions, we could show the monthly maintenance cost of the e-Sales software.

Tracking time usage is possible?
Again, in real-life situations, it doesn't go like this simple.

More than a single team of people might be supporting e-Sales
Joe, Katie and Alice might be supporting other applications than e-Sales
Most problematic issue is - time usage analysis is pretty difficult
So is it just impossible to calculate software maintenance cost? I think the answer is that, it is impossible to give 100% accurate analytics, however, the advance of current technologies like Rescue Time enabled, or at least would enable in near future, to keep track of time usage in an acceptable accuracy. Rescue Time is a very interesting technology we want to introduce more in the next article.
