Pricing and Accounting Software - Income
We have looked into accounting for software about its expense in earlier articles. This articles analyzes the income side of software accounting.


Income from software - illustrated by the single-app E-Commerce company
Like my previous articles, let's continue the discussion about the same single-app E-commerce company, to make the argument simple.


What kind of income does the "e-Sales" software generate? It is only the revenue from the "e-Sales" application. No other income, like license fee, is generated from "e-Sales".

Then, it would feel natural and easy to associate all the revenue to "e-Sales". However...

Revenue is generated from the whole "business", not only from the software
It is not really right to associate 100% of the revenue to the software. Because there are other contribution factors.

For example, if we are talking about financial assets like coupon bonds, it is very clear coupon income is purely generated from the bond.


However, for software, you need hardware running the software application, people supporting the software, etc. In other words, the entire "business" including the software generates the "e-Sales" revenue, not the software only.


Then is it just meaningless to think about "how much revenue does the software generate"? Well, it is still very important, especially when you think about change in revenue, created from software enhancement, replacement, retirement. Or even if running legacy software application without any change, you might see change in the revenue.

We'll explore more about revenue change and software relationship in future articles
