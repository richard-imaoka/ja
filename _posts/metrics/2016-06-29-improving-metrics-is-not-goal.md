Improving Metrics is Not a Goal | Software Investment Science
Metrics are useful, but when a metric becomes a target to improve, it can be harmful.
Test coverage, is typically a misused metric in software.
When coverage declines, you might think it should be improved, but is it absolutely necessary to improve test coverage?
Let’s take a step back and see what your goal is. Creating good software is your goal?
You need to check, and probably keep checking your set of metrics really represent what you want to measure.
You want to measure how good your software is, but higher test coverage doesn’t always mean better software.
Better test coverage tends to result in better quality in software. However, remember there is always trade off. Your time could have been used something more important.
Metrics are still useful, but if you invest huge resources in improving some metrics but you get no benefit, you are made wrong decisions.
