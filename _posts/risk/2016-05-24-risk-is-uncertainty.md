Risk (= Uncertainty) of Software Development and Analysis
Up-front analysis reduces uncertainty of software development, as analysis makes you more certain about the development.
However, still uncertainty remains no matter how much analysis you do. That is inherent uncertainty of software, and is the source of higher return from your software investment.

Risk is not a Bad Thing but Necessary to Produce High Return | Software Investment Science
There is a common misconception about risk (i.e.) people usually think risk is a bad thing, and think it needs to be always minimized. Well, it is true that minimizing risk is a critical aspect of risk management, but high-return investment is possible, ONLY when there is risk.
You will end up with minimum return if you blindly minimize risk.
No risk, no return
The definition of risk is uncertainty in investment. (i.e. risk and uncertainty are two equivalent concepts).
If there is an investment opportunity with absolutely no risk (i.e.) 0% uncertainty, you know the exact return of the investment, then what happens?
Assume there is such an investment opportunity, and it gives you high return, say 30% in a year. Pretty good!? However, people will rush to this same investment opportunity and the cost to enter into the investment rise so high immediately, until the return is diminished to a meaningless amount. That is market mechanism, which you can learn in Economics studies.
Theoretically, such no risk investment gives you only as much return as government bonds, or bank deposit, which are supposed to be completely safe, and risk free. (*) In other words, there is no free lunch.
You earn “potential” high return from investment, because you accept “potential” loss — that is investment
As seen above, 100% sure investment cannot produce higher return than risk-free investment. Higher return is possible, only as “potential” higher return and at the same time you accept the “potential” loss from the same investment.
As you are doing investment, you need higher return. That means you need to accept risks. Investment is essentially expecting return in the future, and you can never predict what happens in the future exactly, so there is inherent risk in investment.
What risk means to Software?
The same argument holds for software. Your software investment, typically software development projects, have risk, they are uncertain.
You cannot tell when the exact completion date is, how much resources are needed, how much cost it will save or incur, how much revenue contribution it will have, etc.
However, if you expect great return from the software investment, you need to accept the uncertainty.
(*) The only exception is arbitrage, which I will explain in other articles.
