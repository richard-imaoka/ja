Risk = Uncertainty, not about high cost | Software Investment Science
Risk is a the most critical but often misunderstood concept in investment.
One common misconception is to equate high cost to high risk, but they are actually two different things.
Risk in investment means uncertainty. So high risk doesn’t necessarily mean high cost, but it just means high uncertainty, more difficult to predict the exact outcome of an investment.
Let’s illustrate the difference between risk and cost
If you have a project that costs a lot, but you are 100% sure how much cost the project requires, then that is not a high risk project. There is no uncertainty and you can exactly predict the future cost.
For example, your project will be completed after 1,500 well known steps, where each step takes half a day exactly, then the project completion date is very predictable.
What is the source of misconception?
Then why in real world, many people think larger projects are riskier?
That is because larger and longer projects usually involve more uncertainty. In a large project, the project completion date can differ from the original plan, in order of years, a large number of new requirements can come in throughout the project life.
These are uncertainty, you did not realize at the beginning of the project.
So yes, a large project tends to be high cost, and shigh risk, but remember they are two different things.
