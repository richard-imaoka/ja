Just Write Code, No Risk and Project Management? | Software Investment Science
Programmers often believe that writing code is the only productive moment. If you do a whole lot of planning, but end up with no delivery, you have zero productivity.
Then can you be successful by just writing code, without risk or project management at all? Let’s see how this extreme “just write code” model works, from an investment point of view.
Writing code only, is like investing your whole money into whatever assets you like, whenever you want. Chances are that you can still be successful with this method.
Software business is investment, and investment is a game of probability. So if you are lucky enough, or you are smart enough to predict future more accurately than others, then you win the game and your software will be successful.
However, with this method, you do not review how much risk have, and what types of risk you face. You only believe in your idea, and your implementation skill.
It is similar to early days of speculators in stock markets, and as you know, some of them were pretty successful without any “formal” risk management method.
