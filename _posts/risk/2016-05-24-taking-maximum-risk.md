Good Risk Management System Allows you Take “Maximum” Risk | Software Investment Science
To achieve a great success in your investment, you need to face a decent amount of risk.
If risk is managed well, the higher the risk, the higher the expected return from investment. So maximum risk will allow you take the maximum return potentially, but of course, the potential downside from investment is also bigger as the risk is higher.
Good risk management does not mean to always minimize your risk. If you always minimize your risk, you will only get minimal return.
In software, a high risk project usually 1) explore new business areas or new technologies or 2) is a long project. 1 and 2 surely increase uncertainty = risk of the project.
If you keep working on very short projects, without doing anything new, the outcome is highly predictable, but you will end up with minimum return.
