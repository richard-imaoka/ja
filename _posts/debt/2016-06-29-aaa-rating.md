AAA, AA, … rating of Technical Debt?
Like Fitch or Standard & Poor’s, we can probably rate Technical Debt.
They rate creditworthiness of corporations, and the rating is reflected when corporations issue bonds.
AAA to BBB- = Investment Grade, you can keep paying cost to such technical debt, as the maintenance cost should be reasonable
BB- to C = High Yield, you must expect super high benefit from your software, as its technical debt costs painfully
Below C = Bankrupt, no worry, you are already dead
