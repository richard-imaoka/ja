Software Replacement Cost is Point-to-Point Calculation
Software replacement cost varies a lot, dependent on:
What/How is your old and new components
What approach you take to replace the target software system/component
Modular software components would likely cause lower replacement cost. However, if such modular components are on a widely shared messaging layer, replacing the messaging layer will be significant work.
So, estimating unrealized replacement cost is difficult, until you decide what to replace to what, and how.
