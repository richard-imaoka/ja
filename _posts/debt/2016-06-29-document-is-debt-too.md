Technical debt, not only about Source Code, but also Document
Source code is widely accepted as technical debt. What about document for the software? Yes it is, because you need to maintain it, and as the amount of document increases, it tends to be more difficult to maintain.

The more amount you have documentation, you feel like you add move values. It is actually a fake feeling of adding value, because more amount of information means more difficult to search for the piece of information you are looking for. Also, it discourages readers to get the whole picture, especially if you put all the information in huge amount of plain text.
OK, then you want to put some diagrams, pictures, for easier read? Remember diagrams, pictures and more visual pieces are harder to maintain than plain texts. What if you need to update a diagram? Picture?
Also you might have crated some videos. Videos are a great way to attract people’s attention, but it has a significant maintenance cost to keep updating it.
See if your plain text documentation is not overwhelming. Your pictures, diagrams and videos need to be easily updated, otherwise, try not to use them in your documentation.
Documentation doesn’t come for free. You need to maintain it like source code.
