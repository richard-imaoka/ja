Late Comer’s Advantage and Technical Debt, Replacement Cost in Software
Late Comer’s advantage favors startups in the software industry.
Typically in large corporations, their business-core, in-house software is based on legacy technologies and that incurs huge maintenance cost. (i.e.) huge technical debt.
Also switching to new technologies is hard for large corporations, due to such huge technical debt. That is replacement cost.
Startups avoid these costs, as they have no legacy software to maintain, and nothing to replace. Of course startup is a highly uncertain business, so not every single startup beats existing big players.
However, as a whole in the industry, startups enjoy late comer’s advantage, and new breed keeps coming into the market. That makes the software industry exciting!
