Software Project is Too Difficult, it is Supposed To Fail
Software projects fail. Yes, they do.
It is too difficult to make a project successful. And making “every” project successful is an impossible target.
No matter how skilled your team is, whatever methodologies you use (e.g. Agile), projects still fail.
When reviewing a failed project, it is tempting to think that “if we have done everything right, then the project was successful”. However, that does not lead you anywhere. The reality is, everything cannot be right:
You have other conflicting projects
You have a limited number developers, limited amount of time
Setting up development environment as well as moving forward in project
Bugs found at late stages, but too much upfront analysis still might not discover the bugs earlier
And too much defensive upfront analysis slows down the project
In reality, there is always uncertainty. If you look back, you can surely tell what the correct decision would have been. However, you could not have made that right decision, as you didn’t know the future.
Also, every decision is a trade-off. For example, if you prioritize a project, then other projects are surely delayed. The problem is, stake holders of the other project might still cause headache to your developers, because delayed projects are not ignored projects.
Your software development project has inherent uncertainty, because you are doing something new. If you are only doing known, small, and easy-to-manage projects, you will slowly lag behind competitors.
And you control your project in difficulty, due to trade off. Making a decision leads to side effects, but the side effects often harms the original purpose of making that decision. You need to keep making decisions given limited resources, considering trade-off.
You should accept a project is something that is likely to fail. It’s a business with uncertainty and trade-off. Nothing different from usual business in that perspective. And as you know, businesses fail, so do projects.
