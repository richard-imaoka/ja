Financial Engineering of Software Projects
Through the history of computers, we have seen explosive growth in the software industry, and people have made tremendous but still ever-growing investment in technologies and methodologies in software development.

Yet there is a question the software industry has not provided right ways to answer...

Do you want to invest in this software project?

This is still a very subjective question. People usually depend on experienced programmers or project managers to give estimate on how long a project takes, and it often turns out to be wrong.

In a series of blog articles, I am going to build scientific and quantitative methodologies to answer to the above question, leveraging frameworks developed in financial engineering.

The software industry has focused on "how" to build software better
There has been an uncountable number of software development methodologies people have come up with, and tried. ( You can see some of these in "Software development process" in Wikipedia ).

Project management styles like:

Waterfall method
Agile methodologies
Programming styles as:
Object Oriented Programming
Functional Programming
or testing styles like:
Test Driven Development
Behavior Driven Development
Also application architectures:
Monolithic architecture
Micro Services
There is a lot more different methodologies in many different aspects of software development.
Lessons, best practices were learnt and shared within the industry, and nowadays people use very sophisticated ways in developing their software, however...

"Whether" to invest in a software project ... ?
We don't know the answer to the question yet.

Yes, it's still crucial to be familiar with software development methodologies and technologies like above, for a successful project.

However, no matter how good you are as a programmer, or as a project manager, still software development takes longer than people would usually expect, and stakeholders are upset by delay or even failure of project delivery.

So you want to know... :

How long does the project take?
How much cost does it incur?
but how can we tell?
Uncertainty, which financial engineering has dealt with in its long history

We need to admit it is impossible to know exactly when a project is finished, at the beginning.

You are deliberately facing uncertainty in project planning, since software development is doing something new in most cases.

So,

Don't rely on, or keep relying on a single number which you estimated at the beginning
Rather, think in a "range" of possible outcomes (e.g. project delivery date) given uncertainty
Illustration of this concept is as follows:

Financial engineering frameworks have a long history of dealing with uncertainty, and provided ways to still make decisions even though you cannot accurately estimate the outcome. Let's enter in the frameworks and in the field from the next article in the series.
