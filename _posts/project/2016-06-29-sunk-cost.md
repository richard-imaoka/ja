Don’t be fooled by Sunk Cost
In business and investment, there is a concept called sunk cost. This is not difficult — it is just cost you already paid and never comes back.
Interestingly, sunk cost really affects how people make decisions. That’s psychological effect.
When a project is at a supposedly 90% complete state, chances are that it is not actually 10% remaining. A lot of problems could have been discovered and not fixed yet, tests or features that were promised at the beginning are skipped due to delay in the project. The quality of the software immediately after the release is going be horrible, and that will require a lot of support effort.
In such a situation, you have to only think about how it turns out in the future. No matter cost you invested in the project, now matter how close the project delivery is, if it is going to cause more troubles than benefits it provides, you should just exit it.
Are you, and is your organization able to make such a decision?
