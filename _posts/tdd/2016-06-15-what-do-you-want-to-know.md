The only way to tell whether TDD is worth learning, is to try it yourself. You cannot tell that by just reading discussions.
You don’t need to start learning it immediately, if you have other more important things to do now.

# Controversy and discussions — is TDD good or bad?
If you are new to TDD, or tried TDD in the past but not very successful probably you are wondering if it’s really an effective approach. There have been controversial and hot discussions around this topic, and some expressed disappointment about TDD like this.
[TDD is dead. Long live testing. (DHH)](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html)

Since it is a fundamental change in the way you write code, you want to know whether it’s good or bad, effective or not.
Well, no matter how good TDD would be, you need effort to learn about it. So, you would want to justify your effort from the benefits TDD provides.
 
# The only way to tell whether TDD is “for you”, is to try it yourself
That’s the only way, like any other methodologies. You need to try it if you want to really know whether it works for you. There is no methodology on the planet, which works for everyone, for any organization and team. The success and failure of TDD is highly dependent on your circumstances:

* If you are starting a new project or you are working in legacy code
* If your company supports TDD or not
* If your company allows you use 3rd party TDD tools
* etc

You will face a lot of challenges after starting TDD practices in your development. If you are just following TDD tutorials, you probably did not face any difficulty. However, doing it in serious business is totally a different story. You see it fail, not in a sense tests fail but the whole TDD practices fail. People resist to new TDD practices. Projects could be still delayed and some think that’s due to TDD.
TDD can only give you what it can, and some teams are successful without TDD, and some other teams fail even though they try TDD so hard.
OK, being realistic, could we still get more sense on how the cost and benefits look like? That is possible. You cannot tell exactly how much effort is required to implement successful TDD practices, but still you can better estimate it with reliable sources of information.
I think you typically expect the benefits like below, and want to know, to what extent you can get each benefit from what amount of effort (i.e. effort vs. return “curve”)
Does it save me from test hell?
What tools are needed?
Does it make me a better developer?
Is it fun?
And i think the following question is important.

# How does an ideal TDD team, or a project look like?
You read enough opinions, discussions, and tutorials about TDDs. Where are real-life case studies of TDD teams, and TDD projects? How does it look like when TDD is successful?
Surprisingly to me, it was hard to find real-life examples of TDD use. It seems like many people just say about what they think TDD would be. Only a few people published detailed show case of their TDD trials.
I am going to review such literature and analyze how effective TDD can be, how it really works in an actual project (not in tutorials), what amount of effort you are required for successful TDD implementation.
