It is about the importance of thinking from a higher standing point.
Once you decided to do test driven development, you ask every developer in your team to follow the practices.
When some team members are not writing tests, or writing messy code with week test sets, you get angry. 
You can ask them harder to do test driven better, and if you communicate with them well, they might do that finally.
Taking a step back, every activity in software is a trade-off. Everything comes with cost. So you should think about what you are paying the cost for. Pay the cost to do test driven development better?
As you decided to do it, you try hard to achieve the state what test driven development is supposed to be — good coverage of unit tests, clean code with clear interfaces, more granular methods and functions, confidence making every single code change. You might be trying too hard to achieve such a state.
Let’s think about why you do test driven development. Why good coverage, clean code, and confidence needed? Because they are properties of good test and good software. Writing and maintaining good test and software are the purpose of your test driven development. However, that is not yet your ultimate goal. Your ultimate goal must be running good business, profitable enough and make customers happy.
Good test assures the quality of your software on every release. As long as you keep maintaining the tests, how you reached to that point doesn’t matter as much. Maybe you maintain test with enough coverage, automated and easily run on every release, without doing test driven development at all. That’s perfectly fine. Having good test is more important than doing test driven development.
Good software usually comes with good test. So the purpose of good test is maintain the quality of good software. Don’t get it in the opposite. I said good test should be run automatically and easily, but when needed, you might do intensive manual testing. If that’s the only way to assure the quality of good software, you probably need to do that. Again, everything comes with cost, so justifying the cost can be done, thinking in a higher standing point.
And even a higher standing point, good software is important because it is supposed to drive your business. On the other hand, fragile and buggy software annoys users, and that could potentially lead to serious loss in your business. Your ultimate goal would be running good business, so good software is part of it, although it is a very important part.
Coming back to the bottom level, at development — If you do test driven development, keep checking if it is really working. When it is not working, maybe you want to try it harder, but at the same time, there could be alternative approaches. When you try harder, think about what cost you are paying for. And see if that complies with the purpose from a higher standing point, and with the ultimate goal.
