Test Driven Development (TDD) discussions
There are a lot of discussions about test driven development, whether it is effective, why someone fails to do that, etc.
I found the below two good articles explaining test driven development, where the latter is actually pretty famous, involving Kent Beck, David Heinemeier Hansson, and Martin Fowler.
I went through the articles. Then I think we should revisit what’s the purpose of test, not necessarily test driven development. The purpose of test is to increase the quality of software. And as always, you should think in trade-off. If you spend too much effort in test, do you get enough quality assurance as a return? Does the effort in test really pay out?
Don’t be fooled by test coverage. It is just a metric, so higher test coverage doesn’t necessarily mean a good thing. Higher test coverage means your code is better tested, but it always comes with cost. Increasing the coverage fro 60% to 70% is worth spending your resources?
I think everyone agrees on the importance of test. So what we need to think about, is how to achieve good quality assurance by tests, under a reasonably low amount of effort.
Ditch those who say TDD gives you whole lots of benefits without questioning about its cost. Also ditch those made-up, too-simple TDD tutorials. Let’s instead face actual code, which is much more complicated than tutorials. And think about what is the right balance to get more benefit from tests with lower effort to create and maintain the tests.
The benefits of TDD are neither clear nor are they immediately apparent * Scrumology
