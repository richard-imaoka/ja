Everything in software comes with cost — The 1st example, Automation

Summary
When someone says, “everything comes with cost”, it feels obvious, but in practice, people often forget about the cost.

As an example, automation doesn’t come for free. Developers need to maintain the software for automation. 
The development + maintenance cost can probably exceeds the gain from automation

## Why people love automation? Because they have underestimation bias on automation’s cost
Non-IT people are usually huge fun of automation. Yes, automation is supposed to reduce cost, produce work faster, 
and more reliable than intensive manual work by human. Although it is supposed to so, the reality is that it always doesn't.
When people decide to develop, enhance or introduce software, they do so by appreciating the benefits that the software brings. 
They look at the bright side of software, but later on they are trapped by the dark side of software. Everything comes with cost, in the world of software. The trap is that often people ignore or underestimate the cost considerably.

## Automation does not always reduce cost, and it could potentially increase it.
Initial development work is needed for automation. Although most people, including non-IT, are aware of dvelopment cost, 
they usually forget that software development projects typically take longer than estimated. If a project overruns, 
it starts conflicting with other projects. The stake holders of other projects are annoyed and extra conversation is needed for prioritization.
What about maintenance cost? There is usually a huge gap between IT and non-IT in understanding maintenance cost. 
Continuous enhancement goes on, and bugs could be found over time. People often extend the use of developed automation tool. Someone from another department might find your automation tool is great, and want to use it. Otherwise, the original requester of the automation might want to support more use cases, which were out of scope originally. If bugs are found, developers investigate them, which could take much more time than the original manual approach to do the work. All of these increase maintenance cost, and the cost could pile up so that the benefit of automation is diminished.
Another important aspect of automation is that you are transferring the cost from non-IT department to IT. If your company’s executives are not aware the cost transferring aspect of automation, your company face constant lack of IT developers. Ironically, the harder IT developers work on automation, the more maintenance work they get. That is negative incentive for developers.

## Software cost comes in long run, and sometimes unintuitive way
The difficulty here is that the true cost of software activities is realized much later, in a very long run. 
It could be or 10 years later when people realize the true cost of automation. 
From a different aspect, to maintain the software, different types of communication is needed, 
which was not needed when you did the same work manual. People forget about it, but communication costs, and it costs significantly.
If you do the work manually, and the work is repetitive, the amount of work is highly predictable. 
On the other hand, if you automate the work, you see cumulative cost of unpredictable IT work.

## Linear nature of cost in manual work, Non-Linear nature of cost in automation
