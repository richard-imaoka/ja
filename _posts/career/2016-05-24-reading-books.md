Reading a book to learn new technology? Better wait until later
Some people like reading a book to learn new technology. However, if you want to learn quickly, you might want to delay reading the book until you build up enough experience.
The best way to learn new technology is work on real-world issues from the beginning. You would feel a pain, because real-world issues have decent complexity, dependency on other components and technology, etc. The pain, anxiety at the beginning, are something you need to live with for the fastest learning.
Before understanding the technology, you should try building up a lot of experience. As a beginner, pay attention to how much work you did, how much code you wrote, and how many. features you added to your software. Every tiny piece of work counts. Pay less attention to how much you studied and learnt.
Follow step by step guidance to create working code, but try not to understand everything at the beginning. A feeling of constant progress in your work is more important than a feeling of understanding. If you get stuck, it’s the best you can ask a co-worker for advice immediately. You should focus on asking what to do, rather than why and how things work.
Then, looking back, you can easily connect dots on your path. At this point, a book can be a great resource for learning. What’s more, you have a sense on selecting a right book for you as you know what you want to learn.
