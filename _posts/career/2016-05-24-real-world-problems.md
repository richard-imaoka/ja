Real-World Problem is the Best Opportunity for Learning
When you start learning new technology do you like learning by tutorials?
Tutorials help beginners, but there is a catch. Tutorials are not real-world problems, but they are made up, removing complexity.
If you have ever made a tutorial, you would have carefully made it so that beginners are not confused. Beginners would get lost in advanced topics, abstract concepts, and dependency on other technologies. So you exclude such difficult things in tutorials.
That is the catch.
A real world problem is always complicated, even for beginners
If you have a beginner in your company, his/her first task still affects other components and someone else’s code. That’s why, beginner's code change is more likely to break your software than others.
You cannot simplify a task for a beginner too much. That is reality — real-world problems are much more complicated than tutorials, even for small tasks for the beginner. The beginner doesn’t understand the stuff firstly, but he/she sees how abstract concepts are applied in the working code, how it is related to other components, etc.
Tackling real-world problems, you build up experience on how the technology is actually used, before understanding it.
This is the fastest way to learn new things. If you look back and learn about what you did, it is much quicker. If you look forward and learn about what you are going to use, it will be a pain, or you will forget it quickly.
Focus on solving actual problems, from the beginning.
With this approach, a very helpful teacher is a co-worker who says “Just do it this way! You don’t need to understand everything now.” and gives you step by step instruction. You might feel an idiot doing what you don’t understand, and you might feel the co-worker is just unfriendly not explaining everything. Set your feeling aside, you are building up experience.
If you unfortunately don’t have such a co-worker, then you probably need to go to tutorials. However, remember not to learn everything in the tutorial, but focus on producing working piece of code. Then as soon as possible, try looking into real problems.
