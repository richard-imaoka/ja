Communication Science, based on Distributed Computation theories?
Famous Pieter Hintjens, the ZeroMQ creator, wrote
The more you need consensus, the less work you can do.

Inspired by his article, I am interested in theories about communication cost related to software development and maintenance. I think Distributed Computation theories and multi-threading practices give hints, like:
Consensus building is costly, as the number of nodes (people) grows
Face-to-face communication is also costly like (Computer) synchronization
Interruption leads to context switch
Are there already such studies?
