Relying on Developer’s Gut Feeling
I believe in developer’s gut feeling. An experienced developer already knows the problems and solutions to the problems in his/her software.
On the other hand, every developer is biased and tends to believe himself/herself is correct. Such bias is not always a bad thing. It is possible that a biased developer believes in his/her idea, pushes it strongly, and his/her project turns out successful. Then the bias was would be called a belief afterwards.
The key here is to let developers explore ideas, as long as your risk tolerance allows. The greatest investment is usually seen stupid at the beginning.

Not only for big investment, million-dollar revenue opportunities, usually experienced developers have ideas about how to improve the working environment. You should let them explore their ideas, and your company’s risk management should allow this.
If your developers are not trying out their own ideas to improve their software, work environment, communication among developers and user, then your risk management must not be working.
