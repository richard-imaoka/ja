Law of Large Number and Software Task Slicing
Assumption 1. you have history of development tasks, and how long each task took (e.g. JIRA)
Assumption 2. you slice a task to a small unit, so that every new task looks similar to some past tasks
Then how long a new task takes follows a probability distribution? I will look for surveys about such predictability.
Certain tasks, especially research & analysis type of tasks, might not follow the expected probability distribution. However, even if we cannot predict every single task, there would be benefit from this statistical method.
