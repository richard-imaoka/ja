Your Agile project failed because you didn’t do Agile correctly … really?
When an Agile project fails, Agile advocate usually says “you didn’t do Agile correctly”.
I agree, mastering Agile would make your project more likely to succeed. However, I think every project cannot be successful.
Software Project is Too Difficult, it is Supposed To Fail

Software projects fail. Yes, they do.

So if we always reason the failure of a project, that “we missed the point or principle X of Agile”, you trouble yourself. Reality is more harsh and you cannot always do your Agile perfectly, given limited resources and time.
Every project cannot be successful.
