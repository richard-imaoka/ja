Software Replacement: Comparison between Cost-Saving and Replacement-Cost Effects
When replacing legacy software with new one, for cost saving purposes, you need to think about replacement cost as well. And comparison cannot be solid as it is probabilistic.

Balance between cost-saving and replacement cost

As in the previous article, "current state" vs. "after replacement done" comparison, is not complete. You need to think about cost saving vs replacement.
Chart of cost and effort throughout the replacement
So, a typical system replacement project might look like this, in terms of developer's effort over time.


Development phase
While developing the new software, the legacy software is still used
New software rolled out
There could be a spike of issues, right after roll out
Legacy software is run in parallel with minimal maintenance, then retired afterwards
Stable phase
After the new software completely released the legacy one, it is expected to run in a lower cost
Comparison on the chart
Adding up the new and legacy software development + maintenance cost, the chart looks like this.


So, the replacement cost is additional cost you pay, compared to the legacy system maintenance cost. And the cost-saving effect is the difference between the new and legacy systems, over time.


If the cost-saving effect (i.e. the blue area) is bigger than the replacement cost (i.e. the pink area), the replacement was successful. Note that the blue area continues to exist over a long period of time, than what is shown in the the above chart.

You have to 1) think about probability, and 2) recognize immediate cost is more weighed than cost in the future
Say, 3 years later, you get huge accumulated cost-saving effect, and as the new software is usually run for a long period of time. Great, so do we always better replace legacy high-maintenance software to newer software? Even though there is replacement cost, since cost-saving in long run pays it off, most likely we just better doing replacement?

Not actually. You need to consider:

Replacement cost is probabilistic, (e.g.) the development might take longer than you expected
Cost-saving effect is also probabilistic (e.g.) new software might be of higher maintenance
Time Value of money
In economics, current cost is weighed more than cost in the future
So, replacement cost in near future, is weighed more than cost-saving effect afterwards, even though it saves cost for a longer period
(i.e.) you need bigger (area of) cost-saving, than replacement cost
We'll cover this in more detail in other articles


Software Replacement as Risk Arbitrage
If you decided to replace existing software for a cost saving purpose, the cost saving effect is not guaranteed, but it is a probabilistic outcome.

If Cost-saving effect is greater than replacement cost, it is an "arbitrage" opportunity
As discussed previously, when you replace legacy software, you need to think about replacement cost and cost saving effect.


And once you find that cost-saving effect is greater than replacement cost, then it is an "arbitrage" opportunity, which brings you "guaranteed" profit.

However, software replacement is "risk" arbitrage, (i.e.) not 100% guaranteed profit
The term "arbitrage" comes from Finance, which means you make guaranteed profit from mis-priced assets. Mis-pricing means some assets are priced too high, or too low.

Coming back to the software world, mis-pricing in this context means, you are paying too high maintenance cost to the existing, legacy software. Thus, replacing to newer, cheaper software means it is an arbitrage opportunity.

However, in real world situations, the profit is not 100% guaranteed, because your cost prediction could be wrong. Let's review typical risk scenarios below...

Case 1 Project Overrun

Project might not meat the pre-defined deadline. In that case, you will need to pay more replacement cost than you predicted.


Case 2 More Dev resources needed

It is also typical that more people are put into the same project in the middle. Or if someone focused 50% of his/her time on the project, he/she is asked to devote 100% later, when it got lagged.


Case 3 Mix of both

Even if more people are put into the project, still it can be lagged.


Case 4 cost is not saved

Maybe the maintenance cost of new software is higher than the legacy software.


Iterative reviews is necessary

It is a risk that actual cost-saving effect and replacement cost are different from what you expected. Do you want to eliminate this risk? Unfortunately "eliminating" the risk is impossible, but you can mitigate it by iteratively reviewing where you are, revising the estimate, as the replacement project goes on.

The iterative review process is so critical in decision making. At each iteration, you should look further and see what the best course of actions, given your risk tolerance.
