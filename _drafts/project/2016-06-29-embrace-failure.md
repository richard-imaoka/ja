Embrace Failure in Software Development Project
Developers and project managers try too hard to make every single project successful. Failure and delay in software projects are supposed to be bad.
Let’s take a step back and reflect on this from one level up. Here is one thing I want to suggest.
Rather than trying to make every software development project successful, what if we accept project failure as unavoidable? Then quickly exit from unsuccessful projects, and shift resources into more promising projects?
Project failure probably means:
You just discovered the project was not worth doing,
Original assumptions turned out to be wrong
As long as you take decent risk in your software projects, (i.e.) you face uncertainty doing projects, trying out new ideas, then you see a lot of cases where you started something not worth doing, your projects started from wrong assumptions.
It is valuable that you discovered you were wrong, and you can only tell you were wrong by looking back, not looking forward. If you look forward and try to tell whether something is worth or not worth, you tend to avoid risk which will make you stuck in the long run.
Embrace project failures, value learning from mistakes, and appreciate you discovered something that doesn’t work. That will make an attitude to take risk and grow yourself.
On the other hand, you need working risk management practices. In this sense, risk management is not something to minimize the risk of project failure — of course that is an important perspective — but allows you take maximum risk, give you maximum learning and growth opportunities given your allowed risk tolerance.
Do you have exit strategies from your project failure?
