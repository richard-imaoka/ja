Estimating the “Value” of Software Development, as well as Estimating Cost?
Cost and cost saving estimation is possible in software, but value estimation is almost impossible
There are ways to estimate cost of a software project. Project metrics, the entire task list, expert estimation … these help you estimating:
How many developers need to work on the project
How long the project would take
Also if you are replacing an existing system, you can estimate its
Cost-caving effect
So estimation in the cost side is possible. However, estimating the value of software development is almost impossible.
“If I implement a feature X, the revenue doubles!!” doesn’t happen in a real world. The best thing you can do is decent market research, and believe in your business strategies.
Estimating the business growth in “quantity” is not possible. You can only bet whether your development is in the right direction, to drive the business.
Also you need a good risk management system in case your bet turned out to be wrong. Take the maximum (allowed) risk to grow your business!
