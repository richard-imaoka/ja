QSM, Quantitative Software Management is a company providing software project management tools based on their quantitative analysis methodologies.


They publish almanac every year and I found an interesting part in its 2016 edition.
As most developers experience, software projects are frequently delayed. If the circumstances allow, delaying the deadline can be economically an effective choice as the below chart shows. Effort here means the number of developers.

If a project can afford to lengthen the schedule, it can be accomplished significantly cheaper by using fewer people (see Figure i.7).
As pointed out in the almanac, there is a known anti-pattern called Brooks’ law. It says putting more people to meet the deadline, at a later stage of a project, does not work. That increases communication cost significantly with little gain in productivity.
The above comment in the [QSM almanac](http://www.qsm.com/qsm/content-access?node=923&title=QSM%20Software%20Almanac:%202016%20Edition), lengthening the schedule is a cheaper choice with fewer people, is the flip side of Brooks’ law.
