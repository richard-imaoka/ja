New Framework, Library? Think of the Balance between Cost-Saving and Replacement-Cost Effects
Developers often know more modern technologies used outside their companies, which would resolve their problems, but they need to stick to the current technology stack. Let's discuss why that happens in more detail, to remove blocks to go to the right direction.

Syndrome - "That software out there resolves my issue"

As a software developer, are you sick of your current clunky development environment and and buggy software continuously causing pain to you? Do you dream of a peace situation with cleaner development processes, easier and more fun development with newer framework, libraries, etc?

You might be thinking like:

Spring MVC sucks => why not use Scala Play framework?
jQuery makes a mess => Angular or even React would be a rescue?
Terrible backend performance => let's introduce async, non-blocking frameworks
Why still CVS in 2016!? => let's do Git!
No manual testing anymore => CircleCI? Jenkins?
It is pretty important developers keep up to the current state of modern technologies, tools, and what technical challenges they are trying to resolve. And yes, they would resolve some of your problems for sure.

However, most likely you suffer the same situation for long, maybe for years or that is never resolved. There are certain reasons why it is as such, and we should carefully analyze this.

Replacement cost matters, even if you know the after-replacement world is a peace

If we use a framework X, then the maintenance burden would be 1/2!
is probably right, but missing replacement cost. End-to-end state comparison, is not enough. (i.e) You need think about not only:

"current situation" vs
"after replacement is done"
but also replacement cost:
learning curve
initial-phase issues
retirement and remediation work for the existing software
etc...
By the way, the 3rd point, retirement and remediation work is what "Technical Debt" discussion covers.
(There is also risk of actually adding more maintenance cost thant the benefit new technologies give, but it's a different topic we will also cover later.)

Right comparison, to achieve better Tech environment
I am going to cover this comparison in more detail, in a series of articles. The purpose is NOT just to give enough reasons to deny the idea of replacement. It is more to give sounding economic rationale, to "achieve" better Technology environment by replacement,
