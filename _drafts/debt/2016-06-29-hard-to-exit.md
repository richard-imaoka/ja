Once you have Technical Debt, it is hard to get rid of
Technical debt always comes with unrealized replacement/retirement cost.
When you switch to new technology, or when you just discard an old unnecessary software component, you need further clean-up work. You cannot “just” get rid of the old software.
The replacement/replacement cost is realized only when you get rid of your software.
Technical debt causes replacement/retirement cost, as well as daily maintenance cost. It is crucial to manage the amount of technical debt, so that productivity is kept in a good level.
