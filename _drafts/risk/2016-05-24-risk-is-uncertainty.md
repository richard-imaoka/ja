Risk (= Uncertainty) of Software Development and Analysis
Up-front analysis reduces uncertainty of software development, as analysis makes you more certain about the development.
However, still uncertainty remains no matter how much analysis you do. That is inherent uncertainty of software, and is the source of higher return from your software investment.

Risk is not a Bad Thing but Necessary to Produce High Return | Software Investment Science
There is a common misconception about risk (i.e.) people usually think risk is a bad thing, and think it needs to be always minimized. Well, it is true that minimizing risk is a critical aspect of risk management, but high-return investment is possible, ONLY when there is risk.
You will end up with minimum return if you blindly minimize risk.
No risk, no return
The definition of risk is uncertainty in investment. (i.e. risk and uncertainty are two equivalent concepts).
If there is an investment opportunity with absolutely no risk (i.e.) 0% uncertainty, you know the exact return of the investment, then what happens?
Assume there is such an investment opportunity, and it gives you high return, say 30% in a year. Pretty good!? However, people will rush to this same investment opportunity and the cost to enter into the investment rise so high immediately, until the return is diminished to a meaningless amount. That is market mechanism, which you can learn in Economics studies.
Theoretically, such no risk investment gives you only as much return as government bonds, or bank deposit, which are supposed to be completely safe, and risk free. (*) In other words, there is no free lunch.
You earn “potential” high return from investment, because you accept “potential” loss — that is investment
As seen above, 100% sure investment cannot produce higher return than risk-free investment. Higher return is possible, only as “potential” higher return and at the same time you accept the “potential” loss from the same investment.
As you are doing investment, you need higher return. That means you need to accept risks. Investment is essentially expecting return in the future, and you can never predict what happens in the future exactly, so there is inherent risk in investment.
What risk means to Software?
The same argument holds for software. Your software investment, typically software development projects, have risk, they are uncertain.
You cannot tell when the exact completion date is, how much resources are needed, how much cost it will save or incur, how much revenue contribution it will have, etc.
However, if you expect great return from the software investment, you need to accept the uncertainty.
(*) The only exception is arbitrage, which I will explain in other articles.


Risk means Uncertainty in Financial Engineering, so does in Software Projects
In Financial Engineering, the word 'risk' means uncertainty. For example, if you buy Facebook's stock you don't know its price tomorrow. That's uncertainty, and a risk. Similarly in software projects, you don't know when your project finishes. That is a risk too.

You can never tell when your Software Project will be finished

The below looks very obvious, and maybe even stupid, but it's the first step to understand what "risk" means in software projects.
Typically in a software project, toward the end of the project, requirements get clearer, people get detailed ideas about implementation, and there are less tasks to do. So, of course, it gets easier to predict when the project is completed, as the project gets closer to completion.
In contrast, predicting the project completion is hard at the beginning. Unexpected issues arise as the project goes on
Sounds too obvious? But that yields into the following definition...
High risk project, as highly uncertain completion date, not a long project
Even though two projects can have the same planned completion date, one might have more predictable completion than the other.

For example, you may be using legacy and well-known technologies in one of the projects, and you can give more accurate estimate on project's completion. The other project might involve newer technologies you are not familiar with. In such a case, the former project has less risk. The latter has more risk.
So, a riskier project doesn't necessarily mean a longer project. If project's completion is less predictable, the project is riskier.
Of course, generally as a project gets longer and larger, its completion date is more difficult to predict though.

Risk in Financial Engineering is not a bad thing
I chose the above definition of software project's risk, to match the meaning of risk in Financial Engineering.

In Financial Engineering, a risk is not a bad thing. Actually, it doesn't mean anything good or bad. It's just uncertainty about the price of an asset.
For example, you don't know Facebook's stock price tomorrow. So that means Facebook's stock price has a risk. (i.e.) uncertainty.
If Facebook's stock never ever changes its value, you have no risk but you cannot get any return from investing in Facebook.
So, if you want a return from your investment, in other words, if you expect upside, you need to accept potential downside as the price of Facebook goes up or down, either way.
That's why I said a risk is not bad - whenever you expect return from investment, there is a risk.
Importance of risk management in software projects
Financial Engineering admits you can never accurately predict any asset's price in the future, but still it allows you manage risks.

The key to manage risks is quantifying them, describing them in mathematical forms. Mathematics don't need to be complicated, but need to be simple and robust enough.
Like in Financial Engineering, if you expect return from projects, you need to accept risks. The converse is also true. If you take a risk, you must be expecting a return (otherwise, what's the reason of you taking the risk!?)

I'll describe how the Financial Engineering frameworks can be applied in the field of software project management, in other articles in this series..
