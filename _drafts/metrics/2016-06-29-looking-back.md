Evaluation of performance — Looking-back is much easier than looking forward Metrics are used to evaluate performance. Evaluating project performance, developer performance, software performance, and business performance. 

Looking forward — it is called estimation.

Estimation is a hard job. There are tons of methods hoping to make it more accurate. That should be a different topic, so I will not cover them.

Looking back and evaluate performance is easier. Since the metrics are realized, no vagueness about the metrics numbers. If you still have vagueness about your metrics, you are collecting impossible metrics.

However, remember that metrics are usually collected as a whole, and getting breakdown is usually difficult
