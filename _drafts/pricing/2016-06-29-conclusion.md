Software Pricing, conclusion
To make your software valuable, you need to consider how much contribution/burden it has to/on your business. Sounds obvious? but let’s review the previous articles:
Software asset value = 0
Software itself doesn’t generate income, your business does
Software debt amount > 0, due to replacement/retirement cost
Software always incurs daily maintenance cost
As you see, to make your software valuable, your software needs to help business to increase income. Also it should save cost for people.
Great software is in that sense, not how clean the code is, or what cool technologies it uses. (yes, clean code and advanced technologies have relation to better business, but not the goal.)
