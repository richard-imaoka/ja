You caannot Re-Sell your Software
Unlike some consumer products like books and computers (PCs), or financial assets like stocks and bonds, there are no secondary (or used) markets for software, where people actively buy products and assets which were once bought by someone else.

Software re-sell is prohibited or impossible
Buying & selling software has a unique characteristics, where you cannot re-sell your software.

This is mainly because:

Software is provided as a "license agreement"
(i.e.) software provider still has the (copy)rights of software
Or no one wants your own custom software
Buy & Sell forms and how Re-Sell is prohibited (M&A as exception)
Let's look at how re-sell is prohibited or impossible in the following forms of software buy & sell transactions:

Packaged Software

License agreement almost always prohibits re-sell to a 3rd party.

Cloud Subscription

Subscription license almost always prohibits transferring subscription to a 3rd party.

Open Source Software

Licenses allow selling it at a price, but anyway no one will buy something already free.

Exception - If you make some customization, selling a modified version makes sense though.

Licenses usually prohibit selling it "at a price". Anyway no one will buy something already free.

In-House Software Development

No one else wants your own custom software.

Outsourced Software Development

Vendor contract might prohibit re-sell, and anyway no one wants your own custom software.

M&A

This is exceptional - since you bought a company, rather than software, you can re-sell its shares.

Conclusion: Impossible re-sell makes software's Microeconomics, risk management different
Since re-sell of software is different, Microeconomics of software and its risk management is different from other products or Financial assets.

I am going to cover Microeconomics and risk management of software, leveraging Financial Engineering frameworks to quantify it, in later articles.
