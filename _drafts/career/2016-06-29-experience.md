You need experience to really understand something. This is true especially in technical matters.

Reading documentation? Books? To master something? Nah you cannot learn everything by just reading text and seeing diagrams.

You need to face real world problems, debug the code and see how the data ogres through the code.

If it's sports, you cannot expect you are a good player by just reading rule books.

If it is mathematics, you'd need to solve problems by hand.(* whether you need to solve problems which computers can solve easily, is a different question.) 

Anyway, remember skills, understanding and knowledge are for accomplishing some tasks, with less effort. Or to achieve a goal which you cannot without them. 


Rather than reading docs, reading source code is better

Rather than reading source code, debugging it is better

Making code change is even better supposedly you do some debugging too

The reason is that, when writing source code you have rich context in terms of what kind of problem you want to solve by the code. Just looking at the code does not give you a good picture.
