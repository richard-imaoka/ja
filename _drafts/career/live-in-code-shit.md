Don't be confused with means and goals.

Your goals are to create output. Finish work.

Your goal is not to write good code.

Writing good code is a means to produce your output quickly and in a better quality in a long run.

if you are not in a situation where writing good code is not encouraged, probably better avoid it.
Especially when you try to force other people to write good code.
