Better to write similar classes at the same time?

A human brain works better if you repeat the same thing again and again over a short period of time.
That's because you get used to the practices.

Short-term memory is needed to accelerate work?

For example, write declaration only for 5, 6 classes, then add method signature, but this point you don't implement them.
It could be faster than writing a detailed single class to the end, or to the working state.
