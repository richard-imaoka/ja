There is always a dream story about automatic code generation.

There were attempts to do that in the history, and even some of them were successful.

One thing to note is, for code automation, you always need to follow some rules.
If you need to remember a lot of rules, it might diminish the productivity benefit of automatic code generation. 

Another thing to note here.
The reality is that it's difficult to tell what kind of practice can be thought as code automation.
If you follow certain rules and generate code .. well do you even need to generate code?
What if you use some libraries or frameworks. You need to follow the rules of libraries and frameworks,
usually represented by API and convention (CoC).

You just avoided writing code which was done by the libraries or frameworks. They, especially frameworks,
might have generated some code automatically. However, the point for productivity is you avoided writing code 
which was unnecessary. And generated or library code are supposedly better quality.

Compilation can be also regarded as automatic code generation?
ORM, etc

The thing is, you should focus on what is unique to you, and balance the learning effort and the productivity gain from 
libraries, frameworks, and code-generation tools.

The longer you use those things, the more benefit you get from them, and your learning effort would pay.

Quantify it ... ?
